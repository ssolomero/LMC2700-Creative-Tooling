# LMC2700-Creative-Tooling
 Your program must take some form of input (i.e. do something while moving the mouse, using the keyboard or whistling into the microphone). It should also be possible to "reset" the program to start a new "sketch." Moreover, your tool should speak to the opportunities, limitations, or broader context of Processing (i.e. what is special about this programming environment) Most importantly, your project must only use code to create its effect. No images, no video files, no data assets of any kind.
